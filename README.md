# A-Comparative-Study-of-Sentiment-Analysis-Techniques-in-AI
This project compares the performance of three sentiment analysis techniques: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Logistic Regression. The models are trained and evaluated on a Twitter dataset, and their performance is optimized using a Genetic Algorithm.
